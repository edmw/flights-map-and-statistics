# Flights Map & Statistics

Flights Map & Statistics is an application to present statistics for a collection of flights and display the flight routes on a map with the ability to filter for specific trips, flights and dates or participating people.

This HTML5 single-page javascript application is a demonstration project to try and learn various techniques used in modern web development. So, although the goal is to have always a high level of software quality expect to see some rather old or quirky things in here. 

## Things to see ...

* I really like the dependency injection!
* What the heck happened to my build file?
* Check out the code coverage ...

## Things to play with ...

* Get rid of the old UI code and use [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* Switch to more modern [OpenLayers3](http://openlayers.org/)
* Bundle locales?
* Bundle external libaries?
